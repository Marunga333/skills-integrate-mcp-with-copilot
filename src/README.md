## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                                                          | Description                                                         |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/activities`                                                     | Get all activities with their details and current participant count |
| POST   | `/activities/{activity_name}/signup?email=student@mergington.edu` | Sign up for an activity                                             |
| DELETE | `/activities/{activity_name}/unregister?email=student@mergington.edu` | Unregister from an activity                                         |

## Database Initialization

- The API now stores data in `src/activities.db` using SQLite.
- On first run, the database is created and seeded with the default activity data.
- On subsequent runs, existing data is reused (no reset on restart).

To reset to default seeded data, delete the database file and restart the app:

```
rm src/activities.db
```

## Data Model

The application uses a simple data model with meaningful identifiers:

1. **Activities** - Uses activity name as identifier:

   - Description
   - Schedule
   - Maximum number of participants allowed
   - List of student emails who are signed up

2. **Students** - Uses email as identifier:
   - Name
   - Grade level

All activity and registration data is persisted in SQLite.
